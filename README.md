Yet another postgres top

![alt tag](https://github.com/zesoup/pg_YAPT/blob/master/preview.png)

A top-like postgres tool.

##Install:
For Jessie, just pull some perl-libs.

    apt-get install libfile-slurp-perl libgetopt-long-descriptive-perl


Some checks are built for special postgres addons.
QTime for example uses pg_stat_statements.
##Usage:
Update the connectionstring in config.pm.
Run the tool.
